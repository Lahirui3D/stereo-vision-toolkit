Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.16 [Development release]

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed crash if no CUDA device found (or using old driver) when calling: 'cv::cuda::getCudaEnabledDeviceCount'

Known Issues:
- Cannot close named pipe server until client connects.
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- WinSock2 streaming is slow and unstable when using high resolution images. 
- Named Pipe streaming is slow when using high resolution images.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
