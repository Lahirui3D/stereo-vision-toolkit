Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.21 [Development release]

Improvements:
- Add shared memory for transfering data to Unity (and other external programs)

Bug fixes:
- Fix 4 channel stereo image pair unable to match 3D due to missing conversion
- RGBD image will now save depth rather than disparity (with scaling x6553 and hFOV in top left pixel of depth)

Known Issues:
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
