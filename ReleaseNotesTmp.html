Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1

Improvements:
- Integration of Vimba cameras
- Add development update branch
- Add about dialogue to show software version
- Add colour image capture to Basler cameras
- Add point cloud image colour texture
- Add point cloud disparity colour texture (z-axis colour)
- Add option to choose point cloud texture (depth or image)
- Separate camera capture and processing threads
- Add in-app download of updates (no longer requires manual download via external browser)
- Add new Vimba camera serials
- Add ML detector using YOLO or Tensorflow
- Upgrade to OpenCV v4.0.0
- Upgrade I3DRSGM to OpenCV v4.4.0
- Added TCP streaming of images / disparity
- Added video saving of individual camera images or disparity
- Added colour to loading/saving stereo videos

Bug fixes:
- Fix YAML file generates invalid Q matrix
- Fix missing link to online documentation
- Fix overwriting image during save
- Fix non rectified images saved with '_rect' suffix
- Fix maximum point cloud z value being set incorrectly
- Fix camera capture delay when processing load is high
- Fix I3DRSGM failed to initalise when switching to camera with different resolution
- Fix inverted BGR to RGB in detection image
- Fix object detection text small on high resolution images

Known issues:
- Vimba cameras unable to read/write settings to/from cameras
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
