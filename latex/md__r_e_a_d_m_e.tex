See \href{https://github.com/i3drobotics/stereo-vision-toolkit/releases}{\texttt{ release}} for pre-\/compliled builds (Windows x64).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{About}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}
I3\+DR\textquotesingle{}s stereo vision toolkit is an application provided for testing of stereo cameras and gathering of 3D data.

You can calibrate stereo cameras, acquire images and perform matching and 3D reconstruction. You can save raw stereo video to capture a scene and then replay it in the software to fine tune matching parameters.



S\+V\+TK is under active development. At the moment the software only officially supports the i3\+DR Deimos and Phobos cameras, but in principle any usb camera pair or pre-\/rectified stereo video of the correct format (side-\/by-\/side) will work.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Roadmap}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Currently S\+V\+TK is a useful and functional tool for exploring stereo imaging, and allows you to get going with your I3\+DR stereo camera quickly. There are a number of features/improvements in development including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item More automated camera calibration (currently in beta)
\item Linux support
\item Unit tests and other deployment issues
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Stereo matching support}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
We have included support for two of Open\+CV\textquotesingle{}s matchers\+: the basic block matcher and semi-\/global block matching. The block matcher will run at over 60fps on a fast C\+PU (e.\+g. i5.) S\+G\+BM should provide better results, but will run around a factor of five slower.

 I3\+DR\textquotesingle{}s own 3D matching algorithm (I3\+D\+R\+S\+GM) can be built into this application however the files required are not included directly in this repository. This is because it uses proprietary libraries owned by I3\+DR. For this reason, these files cannot be open source and are kept in the submodule i3drsgm. However, releases are built with I3\+D\+R\+S\+GM support. Please contact \href{mailto:info@i3drobotics.com}{\texttt{ info@i3drobotics.\+com}} for requesting a license.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The software is currently Windows-\/only, but we are likely to add support for Linux in the future. Currently the only component that is reliant on Windows is some usb camera control, which uses Direct\+Show.

This repository contains everything you need to build the software using M\+S\+VC 2015 (including pre-\/built dependencies.) You will also need an up to date installation of Qt 5 (tested using \href{https://download.qt.io/new_archive/qt/5.10/5.10.1/}{\texttt{ Qt 5.\+10.\+1}}) and the N\+V\+I\+D\+IA Cuda S\+DK. Building with Min\+GW should be possible, but you will need to build the dependencies yourself. You may also need the Windows S\+DK.

Of course you can also link to your own pre-\/compiled versions of the dependencies, in this case you\textquotesingle{}ll need to edit the {\ttfamily .pro} file with the appropriate {\ttfamily L\+IB} and {\ttfamily I\+N\+C\+L\+U\+D\+E\+P\+A\+TH}\textquotesingle{}s.

Installation should be as simple as importing the {\ttfamily .pro} file into Qt Creator and building. The required dlls should copy automatically to the build folder. If the program immediately crashes in Qt Creator, suspect a missing D\+LL (try running directly from the build folder.)\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
The software has three tabs\+: image acquisition, stereo matching and 3D visualisation. This is a typical stereo pipeline\+: images are acquired, optionally rectified, matched and then projected to 3D. You can save images, disparity maps and point clouds (to P\+LY format). Disparity maps are saved as 16-\/bit integer images for convenience, so divide by 256 to get sub-\/pixel measurements.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{3rd Party Content}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
The project uses Open\+CV for image processing, P\+CL and V\+TK for point cloud visualisation and hidapi for camera control. P\+CL requires Boost and Eigen which are included here. These dependencies are provided in accordance with their respective licenses which may be found in the license folder. We also use Font\+Awesome for icons via Qt\+Awesome, along with Q\+Dark\+Style.

There is limited usage of C\+U\+DA for certain image processing steps (e.\+g. rectification).

This repository is used for internal development and so we include both debug and release libraries and D\+L\+Ls. This makes for quite a large repository for a rather small codebase (around 500MB), so be warned.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Development}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
This application is under active development and it is likely that in the short term there may be breaking changes to classes, or significant changes to the G\+UI. Documentation will follow shortly. Have a look at the project milestones for more information.
