v1.2.3

This release contains a revamp to the way devices are loaded at the start of the program and adds Phobos stereo camera integration. 

(Network settings on Phobos cameras are currently disabled due to issues so should be edited from [Pylon Camera Software Suite](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/software/basler-pylon-camera-software-suite/))

Fervor application update checker added to application.
