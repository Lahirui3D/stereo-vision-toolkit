Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.10 [Development release]

Improvements:
- Added image streaming using WinSock2
- Added image streaming using Named Pipes
- Added WLS filter to OpenCV BM and SGBM matchers
- Added hostname and hostID to license message if I3DRSGM license is not found

Known Issues:
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled
- WinSock2 streaming is slow and unstable when using high resolution images. 
- Named Pipe streaming is slow when using high resolution images.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
