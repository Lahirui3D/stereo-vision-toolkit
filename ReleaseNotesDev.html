Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.9 [Development release]

Bug Fixes:
- Fix all videos saved with the name 'stereo_video' even when saving left, right or disparity. Now will save as 'left_video', 'right_video', 'disparity_video'.

Known Issues:
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
