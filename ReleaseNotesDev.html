Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1.4 [Development release]

Changes:
- Add new Titania camera serials
- Remove Vimba camera support in build (source available if this is required)

Known issues:
- ROS perception YAML's data arrays must be on single line in YAML file.
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
