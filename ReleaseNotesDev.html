Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.22 [Development release]

Bug fixes:

Known Issues:
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
