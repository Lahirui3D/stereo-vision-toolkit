Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.24 [Development release]

Improvements:
- Load/save YAML calibrations as ROS perception supported YAML (changed from OpenCV FileStorage yaml)

Bug fixes:
- Fix Titania frame sync issues

Known Issues:
- ROS perception YAML's data arrays must be on single line in YAML file.
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
