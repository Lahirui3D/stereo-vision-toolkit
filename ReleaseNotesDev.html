Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1a.11 [Development release]

Improvements:
- RGBD image sent as 16UC4 image over named pipe for improved speed.

Bug fixes:
- Fix only left image is saved in un-rectified stereo video.
- Fix missing vcruntime10_1.dll. Changed to using generic 2015-2019 vcredist for compatibility.
- Fix missing CUDA dlls. 

Known Issues:
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled
- WinSock2 streaming is slow and unstable when using high resolution images. 
- Named Pipe streaming is slow when using high resolution images.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
